# What is AstraClans [ABANDONED]

⚠️ The project is abandoned. This was an experiment to create clans plugin with Land management. I don't have time for plugin on such a gigantic scale

This plugin allows players to create clans and manage it's territories
 

Astra template has everything(probably) you need including:
- [x] Creating clans
- [x] Deleting clans
- [x] Updating clan info
- [ ] Upload clan images on server
- [ ] Upload clan info on server
- [x] Claiming lands
- [x] Manage land flags
- [x] More things to do
